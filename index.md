Our brain is constantly confronted with sensory information, yet it manages to filter out relevant bits to produce appropriate behavior. Our lab is interested in the _neural computations_ that allow brains to process sensory information and drive _behavior_.

We study __acoustic communication__ in __insects__ using __computational tools__.   
- During __acoustic communication__  for courtship the sender produces a temporally structured signal - a song. The receiver parses that song - for instance to learn about the species or quality of the sender. Acoustic communication in the wild is much more complex than that simplistic description implies: Eavesdroppers may glean information from signals intended for others; Conflicts between sender and receiver can shape the signals and the circuits that process song. We study acoustic communication with this full complexity in mind.
- __Insects__ are ideal model systems to understand basic principles of neural computation: They have small, hard-wired brains which makes them simpler to understand. Yet, they are capable of sophisticated behaviors - including acoustic communication.
- __Computational tools__ serve a two-fold role in the lab: First, as methods for analyzing large behavioral and neuronal data sets. And second, as a glue that brings together descriptions of the nervous system from multiple levels - genes & molecules, small neural networks, or the behavior of the whole organism.

Currently, we're focused on the following questions:
- How do acoustic communication signals shape group dynamics?
- How are acoustic signals efficiently filtered and encoded in the sensory periphery?
- How does genetic variability within and across populations affect the neural processing and behavioral responses to song?
- How do the neural networks recognizing song evolve?
- How is sensory information combined over time to inform behavior?
- How is information routed to motor circuits to drive state-dependent or sex-specific behavioral responses to the same sensory stimulus?
